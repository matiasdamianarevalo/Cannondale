Brett Looks Around
 
Professional musician and Cannondale Ambassador Brett Hite looks at the world(s) around him in the second video of his four-part series, called The Distance I’ve Travelled. The sprawling metropolis of Los Angeles, with its interwoven patches of trails and woodland, provides endless opportunity for Brett to ride his Topstone. On it, he explores the interplay of nature and society, both around him and within him.

Brett Hite is one half of the popular musical duo FRENSHIP. The spirit of his story finds a home at Cannondale, where our calling is to encourage the journeys of others. Join us in following Brett on his.
